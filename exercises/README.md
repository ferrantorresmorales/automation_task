# Interview Exercises for Software Engineers

Welcome to our section dedicated to interview exercises for Software Engineer candidates. Here, you will find multiple exercises aimed at identifying top talent for your team.

### QA

This [exercise](./qa/fastapi) evaluates the candidate's experience and skills in using development practices such as unit testing, integration testing and load testing, and also concepts such as quality. The exercise also minimally evaluates development ability since every profile, whether QA or not, must have basic development skills.

In addition, it focuses on a technological stack like the one experienced on a day-to-day basis in company teams.
